				<p><span>Hello!</span><br/>I’m Sapan Verma - one of India’s most popular and experienced English standup comedians. I’m a co-founder of the East India Comedy, India’s leading comedy collective where I perform, write, act and direct, apart from chasing clients for payments all day. I have done over 700 live shows in the last five years. I have not only performed in more than 30 cities in India, but also in New York, Paris, Spain, Dubai, Singapore and China.</p>
				<!-- <p>I'm Sapan Verma from the East India Company. I am one of India's youngest professional standup comedians with an experience of over 500 live shows. I have not only performed all across India, but also in different cities across the globe <strong>"New York, Paris, Barcelona, Dubai, Singapore and Beijing".</strong> I started doing standup comedy in 2011 and then went on to form EIC with a bunch of comedians, which is now one of India's biggest comedy collectives. At EIC, I perform, write, direct and act, apart from chasing clients for payments all day.</p> -->

					<p>I was a regular presenter on NDTV Prime’s news comedy show The Bottom Line. Now I host EIC Outrage, our online weekly news comedy series that has already crossed over 5 million views in its first three months.</p>
					<p>I’ve also written, directed and acted in a bunch of online viral videos like Sex Education in India, Wrecking God, Ultimate Shaadi Playlist, Ban Ban, Education Then vs Now. Collectively, they have over 1 billion views on YouTube. The international media such as CNN, BBC and Al Jazeera has also covered them.</p>
					<p>I have performed at various auditoriums, college festivals, corporate events and I’m a regular headlining act at The Comedy Store and Canvas Laugh Club in Mumbai. Apart from the usual standup acts, I’m also a part of comedy specials like The Ghanta Awards, EIC vs Bollywood and Backbenchers.</p>

						<p>I’m also a freelance writer, which means I have commitment issues. I’ve written multiple funny scripts for Shahrukh Khan, Farhan Akhtar, Ranveer Singh, Arjun Kapoor, Shahid Kapoor, Ayushmann Khurrana, Siddharth Malhotra, Boman Irani and others. I’ve written the IIFA Awards and Like OK Screen Awards twice in a row now (2014 and 2015). Apart from these, I’ve scripted Filmfare Awards, Star Guild Awards, GIMA and quite a few other events for Wizcraft and Cineyug.</p>

						<p>When I didn’t have any self-respect or money, I used to be a television writer too. I’ve written shows for Channel V, NDTV Goodtimes, UTV Bindass, Colors, Star Plus, Zoom TV and several other channels that are too embarrassing to name.
						<br />
						I’ve also written humour columns for The Times of India, DNA, Grazia, Maxim, Deccan Chronicle, India Today, JAM Magazine and MTV Noise Factory.
						<br />
						In my spare time, I also teach filmmaking and scriptwriting to the media students at Jai Hind College because I like ruining careers.  I also like cats and dogs because they don’t make small talk.</p>
