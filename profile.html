				<p>I'm Sapan Verma from the East India Company. I am one of India's youngest professional standup comedians with an experience of over 500 live shows. I have not only performed all across India, but also in different cities across the globe <strong>"New York, Paris, Barcelona, Dubai, Singapore and Beijing".</strong> I started doing standup comedy in 2011 and then went on to form EIC with a bunch of comedians, which is now one of India's biggest comedy collectives. At EIC, I perform, write, direct and act, apart from chasing clients for payments all day.</p>

					<p>I was a regular presenter on NDTV Prime's news comedy show <strong>The Bottom Line</strong>. I have performed at various auditoriums, college festivals, corporate events and I'm a regular headlining act at The <strong>Comedy Store</strong> and <strong>Canvas Laugh Club</strong> in Mumbai. Apart from the usual standup acts. I'm also part of comedy specials like <strong>The Ghanta Awards</strong> (which is a Bollywood awards show) and <strong>Backbenchers</strong>(a show about college life).</p>
					<p>I've written and directed a bunch of videos and they have been fairly popular (or as the marketing heads call them - viral). The most popular one, 'Sex Education in India', has over 3 million views and was covered by the international media such as <strong>CNN, BBC</strong> and <strong>Al Jazeera.</strong> </p>

						<p>I'm also a freelance writer, which means I have commitment issues. I've written multiple funny scripts for Shahrukh Khan, Farhan Akhtar, Ranveer Singh, Arjun Kapoor, Shahid Kapoor, Ayushmann Khurrana, Siddharth Malhotra, Boman Irani and others. I've written the <strong>IIFA Awards</strong> and <strong>Like OK Screen Awards</strong> twice in a row(2014 and 2015). Apart from these, I've scripted <strong>Filmfare Awards, Star Guild Awards, GIMA</strong> and quite a few other events for <strong>Wizcraft</strong> and <strong>Cineyug.</strong></p>

						<p>When I didn't have any self respect or money, I used to be a television writer too. I've written shows for <strong>Channel V</strong>, NDTV Goodtimes, UTV Bindass, Colors, Star Plus, Zoom TV</strong> and several other channels that are too embarrassing to name.
						<br />
						I've also written humour columns for <strong>The Times of India, DNA, Grazia, Maxim, Deccan Chronicle, India Today, JAM Magazine</strong> and <strong>MTV Noise Factory.</strong>.In my spare time, I also teach filmmaking and scriptwriting to the media students at Jai Hind College because I like ruining careers.</p>
