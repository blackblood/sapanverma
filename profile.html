				<p>I'm Sapan Verma from the East India Company. I am one of India's youngest professional standup comedians with an experience of over 500 live shows. I have not only performed all across India, but also in different cities across the globe "New York, Paris, Barcelona, Dubai, Singapore and Beijing". I started doing standup comedy in 2011 and then went on to form EIC with a bunch of comedians, which is now one of India's biggest comedy collectives. At EIC, I perform, write, direct and act, apart from chasing clients for payments all day.</p>

					<p>I was a regular presenter on NDTV Prime's news comedy show <strong>The Bottom Line</strong>. I have performed at various auditoriums, college festivals, corporate events and I'm a regular headlining act at The Comedy Store and Canvas Laugh Club in Mumbai. Apart from the usual standup acts. I'm also part of comedy specials like The Ghanta Awards (which is a Bollywood awards show) and Backbenchers(a show about college life).</p>
					<p>I've written and directed a bunch of videos and they have been fairly popular (or as the marketing heads call them - viral). The most popular one, 'Sex Education in India', has over 3 million views and was covered by the international media such as CNN, BBC and Al Jazeera. </p>

						<p>I'm also a freelance writer, which means I have commitment issues. I've written multiple funny scripts for Shahrukh Khan, Farhan Akhtar, Ranveer Singh, Arjun Kapoor, Shahid Kapoor, Ayushmann Khurrana, Siddharth Malhotra, Boman Irani and others. I've written the IIFA Awards and Like OK Screen Awards twice in a row(2014 and 2015). Apart from these, I've scripted Filmfare Awards, Star Guild Awards, GIMA and quite a few other events for Wizcraft and Cineyug.</p>

						<p>When I didn't have any self respect or money, I used to be a television writer too. I've written shows for Channel V, NDTV Goodtimes, UTV Bindass, Colors, Star Plus, Zoom TV and several other channels that are too embarrassing to name.
						<br />
						I've also written humour columns for The Times of India, DNA, Grazia, Maxim, Deccan Chronicle, India Today, JAM Magazine and MTV Noise Factory.In my spare time, I also teach filmmaking and scriptwriting to the media students at Jai Hind College because I like ruining careers.</p>
